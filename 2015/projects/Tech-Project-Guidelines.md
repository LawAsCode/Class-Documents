Tech Project Guidelines - Spring, 2015
================================

**Technology and Legal Innovation Clinic, Loyola College of Law**

You are required to produce a technology-related project on or before **May 7, 2015**.
The project should focus on using technology to provide access to legal services or
information for members of the general public or legal practitioners.  It should 
demonstrate your familiarity with the skills we have learned this semester and your
ability to learn and apply new technological skills.

You should submit a written proposal for your project on or before **April 8, 2015**.  The
proposal should specify:

* The name of your project
* A brief description of what your project will do and what legal issues it will address
* A list of the technologies you will use (e.g., Wordpress, javascript, etc)
* A list of project milestones: what are the components of the project and how
will you complete them?
* If you are working in a group, a clear statement of which members of the group
will be responsible for which components of the project.

Grading
-------------------------------

Projects will be graded on:

* First and foremost, originality and creativity.  Have you identified a problem
this is relevant to the law and the legal profession and provided a working
solution?
* The amount of effort you have put in to the project, judged 1) on the number of
hours you have logged in putting it together and 2) the completeness of your source
code.
* Does it actually work? Although it is acceptable to submit a project with some
remaining technical issues, highest grades will be awarded to those projects which
have successfully implemented all proposed functionality.


Project Suggestions
------------------------------

Please keep your proposals and your projects **simple**. You only have a month to 
work with and you are unlikely to create the next Google in that time. The best projects
are likely to use basic HTML and Javascript to solve one single problem.

If you are having difficulty thinking of a project, here are some hypothetical law-based
problems looking for a solution:

* A lawyer notices that reports of DWI arrests (including names and addresses of the subjects
and location of the arrest) are [regularly published in the newspaper](http://search.nola.com/dwi+reports/). 
He would like a way to collect all that data for marketing purposes and to determine generally where in
town DWI arrests occur. How would he do that? [Hint: he needs a [scraper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping).
You can see some useful scrapers [here](http://www.kimonolabs.com/load?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kimonolabs.com%2Fwelcome.html)
and [here](https://github.com/ruipgil/scraperjs).]
* Another lawyer represents developers who remodel and sell foreclosed homes.  He would
like a way to quickly view which properties are available for sale and to see the property's
location on Google Maps. He notices that 
[data.nola.gov](https://data.nola.gov/Housing-Land-Use-and-Blight/BlightStatus-Lien-Foreclosures/aan2-bb5y )
publishes this data and even has an API. (Note that data.nola.gov is great source
for other tech project ideas).
* A lawyer has a solo practice and is moving to [unbundled services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbundled_legal_services)
(meaning she charges a fixed fee for each service she provides). She would like to
add a page to her practice website which allows clients to select from a list of services
she provides and to be given an estimate of total cost.  

Feel free to pursue one of these projects or choose your own.

To start out your project, your best bet is to do a mockup using [JSBin](http://jsbin.com).
If you have a UI, have one project member work on the html, another one work on the javascript, 
another on the data modeling, etc.

Agreement
-----------------------------

The best projects will be further developed and released under the LoyolaLawTech
brand.  Although you will retain full copyright for your contributions to the 
project, you agree that all software your produce will be offered under the 
[MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), unless otherwise agreed by your
professor.
